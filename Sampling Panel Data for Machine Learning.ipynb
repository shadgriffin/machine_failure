For example, if you have 10,000 people measured once, you have cross-sectional data.\n\nTime series includes one entity measured over multiple time periods.  For example, if you have a single machine measured every day for ten years, you have a time-series.\n\nPanel data includes multiple entities measured over multiple time periods.  For example, if you have 1,000 consumers measured over ten years, you have panel data. Or, if you have 100 machines measured over 100 months, you have panel data.\n\nPanel data is quite common in data science. Sometimes, it is called cross-sectional time-series data. I have also heard it referred to as pooled time series data. Whatever you want to call it, as a practicing data scientist, you'll more than likely have to deal with it.\n\nIt is standard procedure when building machine learning models that you assign your data to modeling groups. Typically, we randomly sub-set the data into Training, Testing and Validation groups. Random, in this case, means that each record in the data set has an equal chance of being assigned to one of the three groups.\n\nWhen you are working with Panel Data, however, you will need to alter the normal process a little.\n\nIn this notebook, I walk through a simple example on how to do this.\n\n\n"

I would recommend assigning the group at an entity level (machine in this case).  \n\nWhy?  \n\nWell, I could use some multi-syllabic words (like auto-correlation or mayonnaise) to describe why, but let's just think about it.\n\nWhy do we separate the data into training, testing and validation groups? \n\nWe want to ensure that our model is not over-fit.  In other words, we want to make sure that our model applies to new data as it comes available. \n\nFor example, let's pretend that we built a model that predicts what happened last year with 100% accuracy. Good job, right?  Well, it really doesn't matter how well the model predicts last year.  We need it to predict today, tomorrow and the day after that.  So, if a model predicts last year with 100% accuracy but fails to predict tomorrow, it kind of sucks.\n\nBuilding a model on the training data and verifying the accuracy on the testing and validation data set keeps this from happening.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

That is, we need to ensure that the data in the training group is different from the testing and validation groups.  Or, at least as different as possible.\n\nSo what happens if we just randomly assign each record to each of the groups in question?  We end up with records from each entity in each group.  For example with a simple random selection method, if we are dealing with machines, it is probable that machine 123 will appear in your training, testing and validation groups.  If you are dealing with individuals, it is probable that Steve Wakahookie will appear in all three groups.  \n\nIn other words, your training, testing and validation groups ARE NOT as independent because good ol' Steve and machine 123 are present in all three groups.  \n\nNow, if you assign group membership based on entity, all of the Steve's records will be in either the training, testing or validation group.  Likewise, all of the records associated with machine 123 will be in only one of the three groups."
