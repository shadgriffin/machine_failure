            "source": "In this notebook, I walk through a predictive maintenance problem in great detail.  These types of issues can be tricky for several reasons.  The first six sections deal with building a model.  The last sections deal with evaluating model effectiveness and ensuring it will be effective when deployed in production.\n\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with machines that require periodic maintenance, there are generally three possible outcomes.\n\nOne, you can maintain a machine too frequently. In other words, the machine gets maintenance when it is not required. In this scenario, you are throwing money out the window, wasting resources providing unnecessary maintenance. For example, you could change the oil in your car every single day. This is not optimal, and you will waste a lot of money on unnecessary maintenance.\n\nTwo, you don\u2019t maintain your machine frequently enough. Failing to maintain a machine means that the machine will break while operating. Here, the costs could be substantial. Not only do you have the repair costs, but also costs associated with lost production. If a machine on the assembly line goes down, the line cannot produce anything. No production means lost profit. Also, you will incur legal and medical costs if injuries occurred as a result of the failure.\n\nThree, a machine is maintained when it needs maintenance. This is obviously the better alternative of the three. Note, that that there is still a cost associated with timely maintenance.\n\nSo, we need to maintain machines when they need maintenance, right? Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, we can use predictive maintenance (PM) to predict when machines need maintenance.\n\nI should also mention that most machines come with manufacturer recommendations on maintenance. The problem with manufacturer recommendations is that they represent an average. For example, cars on average need an oil change every 3,000 miles, but how frequently does your car need an oil change? It may be more or less than 3,000 miles depending on several factors, including where your drive, how you drive, and how frequently you drive.\n\nPredictive maintenance (PM) can tell you, based on data, when a machine requires maintenance. An effective PM program will minimize under and over-maintaining your machine. For a large manufacturer with thousands of machines, being precise on machine maintenance can save millions of dollars every year.\n\nIn this article, I will examine a typical Predictive Maintenance (PM) use case. As I walk through this example, I will describe some of the issues that arise with PM problems and suggest ways to solve them.\n\nAn important note about the data used in this exercise. It is entirely fake. I created the data based on my experience of dealing with these types of problems. Although it is entirely artificial, I believe the data and use case is very realistic and consistent with many real PM problems.\n\n\n\n\n"

            "source": "From the data above, it currently costs the firm about $28,000 per failed or maintained machine. Our goal is to lower this cost.\n\nIn the chart above, Timely Maintenance costs more than Unnecessary Maintenance. There is a good reason for this. For this machine, unnecessary maintenance means that that machine was moved off-line and checked, but the part in question showed insufficient wear to replace. Because parts were not replaced, there are no material costs, only labor.\n\nNote that this company does very little predictive maintenance. Most of the time, they just run the machines to failure. Also, note that these machines will break in four to eight years if they don\u2019t receive maintenance. When they fail, they must be pulled off-line and repaired.\n\nOur goal is to show the firm how a Predictive Maintenance program can save them money. To do this, we will build a predictive model that predicts machine failure within 90 days of actual failure. Note that an appropriate failure window will always depend on the context of the problem. If a machine breaks without maintenance in 6 months, a three-month window makes no sense. Here, where a machine will run between 4 to 6 years without maintenance, a 90-day window is reasonable.\n\nOur objective is to develop a solution that will lower the costs of failure. Again, it currently costs the firm about 28,000 per machine. We will attempt to reduce this cost.\n\nNote that I developed this exercise in Watson Studio on the IBM Cloud.

Running summaries of sensor values are often useful in predicting equipment failure. For example, if a temperature gauge indicates a machine is warmer than average for the last five days, it may mean something is wrong.\n\nRemember that we are working with a panel data set. That is, we have multiple machines measured over two years. As we create our running summaries, we have to make sure that our summaries do not include more than one machine. For example, if we create a ten-day moving average, we do not want the first nine days of a machine to have values from the previous machine.\n\nNote that I create twenty-one-day summaries in this example. This works for this use case, but it may be advantageous to use more or different time intervals for other situations.\n"

This means the data sets we use in PM are almost always unbalanced. \n\nOne way to increase the number of failures is to expand the failure or target window. That is, make the dependent variable, not just the day the equipment failed but the 28 days (or another appropriate interval) leading up to the failure.\n\nIn this example, I use a 28-day target window. We will use the 28 days leading up to a failure as the dependent variable in our model.\n"

            "source": "Probably the most confusing element of PM problems is building a realistic assessment of the model.  Because of timing and the small number of failures, understanding how the model will work once deployed in production is challenging. \n\nThere are standard metrics for evaluating models like accuracy, AUC, and a confusion matrix.  In sections 7.1 and 7.2, I will show how, given the transformations we used to build our model and the complexity of the problem, these metrics do not give us a realistic view of model performance when deployed into production.  These standard metrics are definitely useful but are not sufficient.\n\nIn section 7.3, I lay out how I typically evaluate PM models."

Balancing the data significantly alters your base probability of failure.  Remember, before we applied the SMOTE algorithm, about 3.8% of our records were labeled as a FAILURE_TARGET.  After using the SMOTE algorithm, 50% were failures.  Because of this, I always prefer to evaluate the model on the unbalanced data.  Below we will examine the unbalanced data with a 50% cut-off.\n\nAlso, note that the predicted probability from our model is based on the balanced data.  This means it is not the true probability of failure.  The true probability of failure will be closer to .14%, not 50%.  The .14% comes from an average of the original failure variable. (EQUIPMENT_FAILURE).  \n\nI am using the term \"probability,\" perhaps a little too loosely in this article.  Just understand that the probability that the equipment will fail in the real world is about .14% (based on EQUIPMENT_FAILURE).  The likelihood of selecting a day within 28 days of a failure (FAILURE_TARGET) is about 3.8%.  The probability of a failure after we balance the data is 50%.\n "

In the Validation data set, the cost per machine is 22,773.81.  This means a predictive maintenance solution will lower the cost per machine by about 5,174 dollars per machine.  Multiplied by 421 machines, the equates to a 2.17 Millon saving or an 18% reduction in total expenses.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\nOne final note. There are many judgments I made that work for this example but may not work for you. Unfortunately, there is no \u201cone size fits all\u201d solution for any data science problem.\n\nNonetheless, this exercise should give you a useful reference as you approach these types of problems in the future.\n\nAs far as the next steps, I would encourage you to see if you can improve the solution by optimizing the model. Maybe incorporate some hyper-parameter optimization or even try a different model. Let me know how it turns out!\n"
