Augmented and improved again in August 2022."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "In this notebook, I walk through a predictive maintenance problem in great detail.  These types of issues can be tricky for several reasons.  The first six sections deal with building a model.  The last sections deal with evaluating model effectiveness and ensuring it will be effective when deployed in production.\n\n\nWhen it comes to dealing with machines that require periodic maintenance, there are generally three possible outcomes.\n\nOne, you can maintain a machine too frequently. In other words, the machine gets maintenance when it is not required. In this scenario, you are throwing money out the window, wasting resources providing unnecessary maintenance. For example, you could change the oil in your car every single day. This is not optimal, and you will waste a lot of money on unnecessary maintenance.\n\nTwo, you don\u2019t maintain your machine frequently enough. Failing to maintain a machine means that the machine will break while operating. Here, the costs could be substantial. Not only do you have the repair costs, but also costs associated with lost production. If a machine on the assembly line goes down, the line cannot produce anything. No production means lost profit. Also, you will incur legal and medical costs if injuries occurred as a result of the failure.\n\nThree, a machine is maintained when it needs maintenance. This is obviously the better alternative of the three. Note, that that there is still a cost associated with timely maintenance.\n\nSo, we need to maintain machines when they need maintenance, right? Unfortunately, this is easier said than done. Fortunately, we can use predictive maintenance (PM) to predict when machines need maintenance.\n\nI should also mention that most machines come with manufacturer recommendations on maintenance. The problem with manufacturer recommendations is that they represent an average. For example, cars on average need an oil change every 3,000 miles, but how frequently does your car need an oil change? It may be more or less than 3,000 miles depending on several factors, including where your drive, how you drive, and how frequently you drive.\n\nPredictive maintenance (PM) can tell you, based on data, when a machine requires maintenance. An effective PM program will minimize under and over-maintaining your machine. For a large manufacturer with thousands of machines, being precise on machine maintenance can save millions of dollars every year.\n\nIn this article, I will examine a typical Predictive Maintenance (PM) use case. As I walk through this example, I will describe some of the issues that arise with PM problems and suggest ways to solve them.\n\nAn important note about the data used in this exercise. It is entirely fake. I created the data based on my experience of dealing with these types of problems. Although it is entirely artificial, I believe the data and use case is very realistic and consistent with many real PM problems.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "The firm in our use case provided a sample of data that includes 421 machines that failed over two years. They spent 11.766M dollars on maintenance, most of which came from running machines until failure.\n\nHere is a summary of the maintained or repaired machines over the last two years."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "from IPython.display import Image\nfrom IPython.core.display import HTML \nImage(url= \"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fUKUEUeqgIYU9xlxj4pwhw.png\")", "execution_count": 2, "outputs": [{"output_type": "execute_result", "execution_count": 2, "data": {"text/html": "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*fUKUEUeqgIYU9xlxj4pwhw.png\"/>", "text/plain": "<IPython.core.display.Image object>"}, "metadata": {}}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "From the data above, it currently costs the firm about $28,000 per failed or maintained machine. Our goal is to lower this cost.\n\nIn the chart above, Timely Maintenance costs more than Unnecessary Maintenance. There is a good reason for this. For this machine, unnecessary maintenance means that that machine was moved off-line and checked, but the part in question showed insufficient wear to replace. Because parts were not replaced, there are no material costs, only labor.\n\nNote that this company does very little predictive maintenance. Most of the time, they just run the machines to failure. Also, note that these machines will break in four to eight years if they don\u2019t receive maintenance. When they fail, they must be pulled off-line and repaired.\n\nOur goal is to show the firm how a Predictive Maintenance program can save them money. To do this, we will build a predictive model that predicts machine failure within 90 days of actual failure. Note that an appropriate failure window will always depend on the context of the problem. If a machine breaks without maintenance in 6 months, a three-month window makes no sense. Here, where a machine will run between 4 to 6 years without maintenance, a 90-day window is reasonable.\n\nOur objective is to develop a solution that will lower the costs of failure. Again, it currently costs the firm about 28,000 per machine. We will attempt to reduce this cost.\n\nNote that I developed this exercise in Watson Studio on the IBM Cloud.

Specifically, we will create running summaries of the sensor values. Running summaries of sensor values are often useful in predicting equipment failure. For example, if a temperature gauge indicates a machine is warmer than average for the last five days, it may mean something is wrong.\n\nRemember that we are working with a panel data set. That is, we have multiple machines measured over two years. As we create our running summaries, we have to make sure that our summaries do not include more than one machine. For example, if we create a ten-day moving average, we do not want the first nine days of a machine to have values from the previous machine.\n\nNote that I create twenty-one-day summaries in this example.

I usually fine-tune these parameters with the testing and training data sets, then confirm the accuracy with the validation data set.\n\nThe first parameter is the Forecast Window.  \n\nThe Forecast Window is the length of time a failure signal projects into the future.  \n\nFor example, if there is a failure signal on June 1st, how long is that signal last?  \n\nDoes it mean the machine will break in the next second, minute, hour, day, or month? \n\nNote that the forecast window length depends on the problem's context.  If a machine runs to failure in 10 years, the forecast window will be relatively long, perhaps as long as six or nine months.  If a machine runs to failure in 1 day, the forecast window will be much shorter, maybe an hour or a few minutes.  The length of the forecast window must be helpful to the problem.  For example, a twenty-eight-day forecast window for a machine that runs to failure in thirty days is of little value.  \n\nIn our current use case, the machine runs to failure in four to six years, so a ninety-day forecast window is reasonable.\n\nWe also need to define a cut-off value.  In this first example, we will use a cut-off value of .50.  The cut-off value determines if a prediction is a failure or a non-failure.

If multiple failure signals occur in a ninety-day window, these signals will be aggregated and associated with the first signal.\n\nFor example, assume you have a signal on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Here, we have a single failure signal measured over four days, not four different signals measured over four different days. The latter situation really doesn\u2019t make sense. The problem on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are not indpendent from the one on Monday. The four are connected. They have to be and even if they are not, you should have checked and repaired the machine after the first signal.\n\nGiven this, to get an accurate model assessment, we must consolidate the four signals and associate them with the first day in the series of signals (Monday). In other words, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday signals are redundant and subject to removal.\nAgain, a signal of failure is good for 90 days (forecast window), so a signal that occurs inside the 90-day window of an earlier signal is not, by definition, NOT a separate signal of failure.\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back and look at this pragmatically. If you get a failure signal today, you will take action and check the machine immediately, right? Isn\u2019t the whole point here? We only have consecutive signals in the historical data because the model does not exist yet. In a real-world situation, successive failure signals should not occur. A signal will prompt the business to check the machine. At that point, the signal becomes either a false positive or a true positive, end of the story.\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Sort the data by id and date."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "\nxx=df\nxx=xx.sort_values(by=['ID','DATE'], ascending=[True, True])", "execution_count": 88, "outputs": []}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Create a unique list of machines"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "code", "source": "\naa=xx\n\npd_id=aa.drop_duplicates(subset='ID')\npd_id=pd_id[['ID']]\npd_id.shape", "execution_count": 89, "outputs": [{"output_type": "execute_result", "execution_count": 89, "data": {"text/plain": "(295, 1)"}, "metadata": {}}]}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Label each machine with a sequential number.

In the Validation data set, the cost per machine is 24,380.  A predictive maintenance solution will lower the cost per machine by about 3,567 dollars per machine in the validation set.  To be conservative, we should probably take the lower of the testing and validation data sets, so let's use 2,860 as a lift over the BAU metric.  The lift multiplied by 421 machines equates to 1.204 million in savings or about a 10% reduction in total expenses.\n\nNot too shabby.\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Author\n\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "\n**Shad Griffin**, is a Certified Thought Leader and Data Scientist at IBM"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "<hr>\nCopyright &copy; IBM Corp. 2020.
